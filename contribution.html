          <h2>Volunteer</h2>
          <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for
            visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a
            working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come
            together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more
            about how you can get involved.</p>
          <h2>Internships</h2>
          <p>Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of
            nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
            You’ll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about science and
            sharing it with the wider community.</p>
