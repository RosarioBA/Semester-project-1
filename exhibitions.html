        <h2>Cosmology</h2>
        <div class="exhibition-column">
          <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night sky and
            what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies
            that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by.
            Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
            exploration of the planets in our solar system.</p>

        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <div class="exhibition-column">
          <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come
            from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for
            exploring and understanding our place in this world.
            Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can
            also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the
            Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

        <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
        <div class="exhibition-column">
          <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into
            the great wonders of the tiny world.
            For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the
            growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
            take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart
            transplant.
            Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in
            the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

        <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>
        <div class="exhibition-column">
          <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the future.
            From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You can even say
            hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

        <h2>Ecology</h2>
        <div class="exhibition-column">
          <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that
            scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming,
            extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a
            brighter future.</p>

        <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
        <div class="exhibition-column">
          <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of the elements
            as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able
            to use and control wind to create power.</p>
