# Semester Project 1
A website created for a course assignment, targeting a young audience with specific interests. The goal was to design and develop an engaging, user-friendly website with a clean layout and a vibrant pastel color palette.


# Description
This project is a website designed for an interactive science museum called the Community Science Museum, targeting primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The aim is to excite and entice people to visit the museum with a modern, accessible, and responsive web presence.

# Key Features
- User-friendly navigation: Easy to use for all ages.
- Responsive design: Adapts to various screen sizes.
- Hamburger menu for mobile devices: Simplifies navigation on smaller screens.
- SEO and accessibility enhancements: Ensures better reach and usability.

# Built With
- HTML5
- CSS3

# Getting Started
Installing
1. Clone the repo: 
git clone https://github.com/NoroffFEU/semester-project-1.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd semester-project-1

# Running
To view the website, open the index.html file in a web browser.

# Planning Process
During the planning phase, I utilized GitHub's project feature and Kanban board to break down tasks and allocate time estimates, keeping things organized and on schedule. Additionally, I employed Notion to manage project notes, sources, and requirements, which significantly streamlined the process and helped avoid previous pitfalls of forgetting tasks.

# Design Process
In the design phase, I focused on the target audience—a 10-year-old girl—by creating a detailed user profile. I chose a pastel color palette to create a fun and vibrant atmosphere, ensuring the website was engaging and visually appealing for both children and their parents. The design emphasized a clean and easily navigable layout.

# Build Process
The development phase involved constructing the website with HTML and CSS, adhering to best practices like the DRY principle for efficient and maintainable code. Challenges included achieving responsive design across various devices and implementing a responsive navigation menu. These were overcome by designing for smaller screens first and using media queries.

# Testing Process
The testing phase ensured the website's functionality and usability across different browsers and devices. Tools were used to validate code, check accessibility, and gather feedback from the target audience. This comprehensive testing helped identify and fix issues, enhancing the website's overall quality.
